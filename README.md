# Incubator
We want to build an open source Incubator for biology lab in Cameroon; since most of them are under-equipped due to the high cost of lab equipment. We believe that DIY and Open Science Hardware, can facilitate access to low-cost and high-quality equipment for biology labs in Cameroon and Africa. We are a team of 4 people, based in Yaound√©, Cameroon.
